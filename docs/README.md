## Usage

The main section of the webpage contains a header as a title, and a card with head, body and footer. The card header acts as instructions, the car body is the text area that holds the generated password and the card footer holds the button which is listening for the click event to occur. Once clicked, the user's input is gathered about their parameters for a password, the parameters are then used to create an array which the password is randomly generated from. The final output will be on the card body replacing the filler text, "Your Secure Password".
